This assignment involved the analysis of Hyperparameters from a theoritical and technical standpoint.  

Which activation function performed the best?

Tanh

Why?

For this particular problem, regression model that predicts student's performance. Logistic seemed to have performed the best with MSE. 
The lowest MSE model is 2. The logistic activation is considered to be best with learning rate of .01 and max iteration of 100 and 3 hidden layers. There are many reasons that logistic did the best.
